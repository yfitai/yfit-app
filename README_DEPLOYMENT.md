## 🔑 Environment Variables You'll Need

For Vercel deployment, you'll need these three values:

1. **VITE_SUPABASE_URL** - Your Supabase project URL
2. **VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY** - Your Supabase public key
3. **VITE_USDA_API_KEY** - Your USDA API key (or use `DEMO_KEY`)

See `VERCEL_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` for detailed instructions on where to find these.

## ✨ After Deployment

Once your app is deployed to Vercel, you'll still need to:

1. **Deploy Supabase Edge Functions** - Backend automation for:
   - Email marketing campaigns
   - Social media content generation
   - Analytics aggregation
   - User email setup

2. **Configure Stripe Tax Collection** - 15-minute setup in Stripe Dashboard

Guides for both are ready and will be provided after successful deployment!
