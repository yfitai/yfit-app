      <h2>HIPAA Compliance Notice</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Effective Date: October 29, 2025</p>

      <h3>1. HIPAA Applicability</h3>
      <p>
        YFIT AI is a personal health and fitness tracking application. We are <strong>not</strong> a covered entity under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) as we do not provide healthcare services, health insurance, or healthcare clearinghouse functions.

      <h3>2. Protected Health Information (PHI)</h3>
      <p>
        While we collect health-related data (weight, fitness goals, medication schedules), this data is <strong>not</strong> considered PHI under HIPAA because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We are not a healthcare provider</li>
        <li>Data is collected directly from you, not from healthcare providers</li>
        <li>We do not transmit data to healthcare providers for treatment purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Data Protection Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Although we are not HIPAA-covered, we implement security measures comparable to HIPAA standards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data in transit and at rest</li>
        <li>Access controls and authentication</li>
        <li>Regular security audits</li>
        <li>Secure data storage with Supabase</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Healthcare Provider Integration</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose to share your YFIT AI data with your healthcare provider, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable regulations.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
