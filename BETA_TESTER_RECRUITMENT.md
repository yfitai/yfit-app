## 📧 **Version 1: Close Friends & Family (Personal)**

**Subject:** Quick favor? Need your help testing my fitness app 🏋️

```
Hey [Name]!

I have a huge favor to ask - and I promise it's quick and easy!

I've been working on YFIT, my fitness tracking app, and I'm finally ready to launch it on Google Play. But before Google will approve it for public release, I need 12 people to beta test it for 2 weeks.

That's where you come in! 😊

**What you'd do:**
• I'll add your Gmail address to the beta tester list
• Google sends you a link to download the app
• Use it a few times over the next 2 weeks (log a meal, track a workout, whatever you want)
• That's literally it!

**What's in it for you:**
• Free lifetime access to all Pro features (normally $249.99) as a thank you
• You'll be one of the first to use an AI-powered fitness app that tracks workouts, nutrition, AND medications all in one place
• Bragging rights that you helped launch YFIT 🚀

No payment required, no commitment after the 2 weeks, and you can uninstall anytime.

Can you help me out? If yes, just reply with your Gmail address and I'll get you set up today!

Thanks so much,
[Your Name]
