## üéØ Goal
Get your YFIT AI app deployed to GitHub and Vercel with the correct folder structure.

---

## ‚ö° FASTEST METHOD (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (Web Interface)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `yfit-app`
   - Description: `YFIT AI - Comprehensive Fitness & Health Tracking App`
   - Visibility: **Public** (recommended for easier deployment)
   - **UNCHECK** "Add a README file"
   - **UNCHECK** "Add .gitignore"
   - **UNCHECK** "Choose a license"
3. **Click:** "Create repository"

### Step 2: Create Personal Access Token

You need this to push code to GitHub.

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Fill in:**
   - Note: `YFIT Deployment`
   - Expiration: `90 days` (or your preference)
   - **Check:** `repo` (this will check all sub-items automatically)
3. **Click:** "Generate token"
4. **COPY THE TOKEN** - you'll need it in the next step
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è You can only see it once! Save it somewhere safe.

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

I'll provide you with commands to run. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use the Automated Script (Easiest)

I've created a script that does everything for you. You just need to:

1. Download the `yfit-deploy` folder to your computer
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd path/to/yfit-deploy`
4. Run: `./DEPLOY.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `bash DEPLOY.sh` (Windows Git Bash)
5. When prompted, enter:
   - Username: `yfitai`
   - Password: **Paste your Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

#### Option B: Manual Commands (If script doesn't work)

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
cd /path/to/yfit-deploy
git remote add origin https://github.com/yfitai/yfit-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: `yfitai`
- Password: **Your Personal Access Token**

## üöÄ After GitHub Upload is Complete

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com
2. **Log in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click:** "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
4. **Import** your `yfit-app` repository
5. **Configure:**
   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave as default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (should be auto-detected)
   - Output Directory: `dist` (should be auto-detected)

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables

Before deploying, click "Environment Variables" and add these:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anon/public key |
| `VITE_USDA_API_KEY` | Your USDA API key |

**Where to find these:**
- **Supabase:** Go to your Supabase project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
- **USDA:** Your existing API key or get one at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html

### Step 6: Deploy!

1. **Click:** "Deploy"
2. **Wait** 2-3 minutes for build to complete
3. **Done!** Your app will be live at `https://yfit-app-xxx.vercel.app`
